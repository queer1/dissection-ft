** Dissection Forensic Toolkit (DFT) **
***************************************

DFT is a collection of forensic tools by Juan C. Rodr√≠guez Cruces oriented for Unix system. 

The considered main tasks are:

* Data carving to recover images that are missing in a hard drive. 
* Image viewer to check the recovered images.
* Timeline created overlapping Unix logs.
* Event viewer to check the timeline of a Unix system.
* Exports a PDF file with the report of the analysis made in LaTeX.

DFT requires that the system has perl, version 5.0004 or later.
It's required several megabytes of storage for the output.
