** Dissection Forensic Toolkit (DFT) **
***************************************

DFT is a collection of forensic tools oriented for Unix system.

The main tasks are:
* Data carving to recover images that are missing in a hard drive. 
* Image viewer to check the recovered images.
* Event viewer to check the timeline of a Unix system.
* Exports a PDF file with the report of the analysis made in LaTeX.

DFT requires that the system have perl, version 5.0004 or later.
It's required several megabytes of storage for the output.
